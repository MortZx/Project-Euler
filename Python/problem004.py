'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from 
the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Finds the largest palindrome made from the product of two n-digit specific
numbers. Iterate through all possible numbers and save all palindroms in a list. 
!! appending to list is costly !!

@param integer - number of digits for multiplied numbers
